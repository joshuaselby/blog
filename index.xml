      <description>On May 14, 1796 Edward Jenner took fluid from a cowpox blister and scratched it onto the skin of James Phipps, an eight year old.
A single blister rose up on the spot, but James soon recovered.
On July 1, Edward Jenner inoculated the boy again. This time with smallpox matter and no disease developed.
The vaccine was a success.</description>
