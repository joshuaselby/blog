    <p>If I was in charge of the world I would beat the Coronavirus. I would make sure everyone got to the hospital. I would make sure people do not litter and everyone had food and a home.</p>

    <p>Once, I had a magic wand, of it I was so very proud.
First I saw a bog, Bang! It turned into a dog.
Next, I saw a hat, Boom! It turned into a cat.
Next, I saw a pen, Whoosh! It turned into a hen.
Last, I saw a horrid house, Crash! It turned into a mouse.</p>
